# Plant Tracker

A React app for keeping track of watering houseplants. Set a watering cycle for each plant, and the app will show you when it's time to water it next.

Note: the app has been optimized for mobile, desktop layout is still a work in progress.

## Features

-   Add, edit, and delete plants
